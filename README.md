# Scibowl Questions
A repository of extracted images and json dataset of all(or at least most) Middle School and High School DOE National Science Bowl questions.

The PDFs are taken from http://science.energy.gov/wdts/nsb/high-school/high-school-regionals/hs-rules-forms-resources/sample-science-bowl-questions/, and http://science.energy.gov/wdts/nsb/middle-school/middle-school-regionals/middle-school-resources/sample-questions/, and the images and json file were generated by parsing the PDFs with the Apache PDFBox library.
